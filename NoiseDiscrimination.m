% ALTERNATE FOR ESCAPE KEY: The 2017 MacBook Pro with the task bar has no
% built-in ESCAPE key. (The task bar sometimes simulates ESCAPE key, but I
% don't know if we can count on it being there.) To support computers
% without ESCAPE keys, NoiseDiscrimination accepts the GRAVE ACCENT key as
% equivalent to the ESCAPE key.
%
% SNAPSHOT. It is useful to take snapshots of the stimulus produced by
% NoiseDiscrimination. Such snapshots can be used in papers and talks to
% show our stimuli. If you request a snapshot then NoiseDiscrimination
% saves the first stimulus to a PNG image file and then quits with a fake
% error. To help you keep track of how you made each stimulus image file,
% some information about the condition is contained in the file name and in
% a caption on the figure. The caption may not be included if you enable
% cropping. Here are the parameters that you can control:
% o.saveSnapshot=true; % If true, take snapshot for public presentation.
% o.snapshotContrast=0.2; % nan to request program default.
% o.cropSnapshot=false; % If true, crop to include only target and noise,
%                   % plus response numbers, if displayed.
% o.snapshotCaptionTextSizeDeg=0.5;
%
% Standard condition for counting V1 neurons: o.noiseCheckPix=13;
% height=30*o.noiseCheckPix; o.viewingDistanceCm=45; SD=0.2, o.targetDurationSec=0.2 s.
%
% BRIGHTNESS SEEKER. Observer 'brightnessSeeker' is a model of the human
% observer with a saturation of brightness, based on an old research
% project of mine. As the noise gets stronger, this artificial o.observer
% "sees" it as dimmer and will identify the dim letter or choose the
% dimmest square. The strength of the saturation is set by
% "o.observerQuadratic=-1.2;" There's no need to adjust that. If we make
% that number big, like -10, this o.observer performs much like the ideal.
% If the number is zero, it'll be just guessing. I'm pretty sure -1.2 is
% the right setting.
%
% ANTIALIASING ARTIFACTS. It wasn't easy to get the instructional text to
% image well. It's black, on a gray background, but the antialiasing in the
% font rendering surrounded each letter with with intermediate levels of
% gray. The intermediate values were problematic. In my CLUT, the
% intermediate values between gray (roughly 0.5) and black (0) were much
% closer in luminance to the gray, making the letter seem too thin. Worse,
% I am computing a new color table (CLUT) for each trial, so this made the
% halo around the instructions flicker every time the CLUT changed.
% Eventually I realized that black is zero and that by making the gray
% background have an index of 1, the letters are indeed binary, since the
% font rendering software emits only integers and there are no integers
% between 0 and 1. This leaves me free to do whatever I want with the rest
% of the color table. The letters are imaged well, because the antialiasing
% software is allowed to do its best with the binary gamut.
%
% Similarly, it wasn't easy to put the signal on the screen without getting
% a dark halo on the MacBookPro Retina display. That display, like other
% high-resolution displays, insists on interpolating around the edge.
% Pasting a grayscale image (128) on a background set to 1 resulted in
% intermediate pixel values which were all darker than the background gray.
% I fixed this by making the background be 128. Thus the background is
% always gray o.LBackground, but it's produced by a color index of 128 inside
% stimulusRect, and a color index of 1 outside it. This is drawn by calling
% FillRect with 1 for the whole screen, and again with 128 for the
% stimulusRect.
%
% FIXATION CROSS. The fixation cross is quite flexible. You specify its
% size (full width) and stroke thickness in deg. If you request
% o.fixationCrossBlankedNearTarget=1 then we maintain a blank margin (with
% no fixation line) around the target that is at least a target width (to
% avoid overlap masking) and at least half the eccentricity (to avoid
% crowding). Otherwise the fixation cross is blanked during target
% presentation and until o.fixationCrossBlankedUntilSecAfterTarget.
%
% ANNULAR GAUSSIAN NOISE ENVELOPE. Use these three parameters to specify an
% annular gaussian envelope. The amplitude is a Gaussian of R-Ra where R is
% the distance from letter center and Ra is
% o.annularNoiseEnvelopeRadiusDeg. When Ra is zero, this reduces to a
% normal gaussian centered on the letter. The code now computes a new
% summary of the "area" of the envelope: o.centralNoiseEnvelopeE1DegDeg We
% should equate this when we compare hard edge annulus with gaussian
% envelope.

% 1. Set displayNearPointXYDeg to eccentricityXYDeg, roughly.
% 2. Set displayNearPointXYPix according to o.nearPointXYInUnitSquare.
% 3. Ask viewer to adjust display so desired near point is at desired viewing distance and orthogonal to line of sight from eye.

% 2. It would be nice to make more use of AskQuestion, since its page is
% easier to read than most of my current question pages. 
% 3. I'm unsure whether the question pages should be dim, like the
% experiment, to maintain dark adaptation, or bright for readability.
% 4. There seems to be a bug in MATLAB. When I declare "signal" global,
% this is ignored. It is assigned a struct array in the main program, but
% when I access it in a subrouting, it's empty or undefined (i don't
% remember), even though it's declared as global in both. Several other
% variables are also declared global and work as expected.

% REPLICATING MANOJ'S NEQ MEASUREMENTS

% We pursued many leads, and found two causes: 1. contrast calibration
% error and 2. lack of auditory cueing.
%
% 1. CONTRAST. We discovered a bug deep in my gamma-correction
% contrast-control software. in effect the displayed contrast of everything
% on the screen was roughly half of what it was supposed to be. this caused
% thresholds on a blank screen to be over-estimated by roughly a factor of
% 2. it did not affect thresholds in noise, because the calibration error
% attenuates signal and noise equally, resulting in the same
% signal-to-noise ratio, which is what determines performance. doubling the
% reported threshold contrast quadruples E0, which roughly quadruples Neq=
% N*E0/(E-E0). That's why Hormet's estimates of Neq were about a factor of
% 4 too high.
%
% 2. CUEING. Without a beep, threshold for the signal without noise was
% raised and variable, because there's no way to know when the signal
% occurs. When visual noise is present, the noise cues the time of
% presentation. Adding the beep made threshold without noise about a factor
% of 0.7 lower, and much more reliable.
%
% Along the way, not knowing which difference mattered, we tried to
% reproduce Manoj's signal and noise. We switched from Sloan to Bookman
% (which required enhancing our new software to work with any font) and we

% MAY 31, 2017 from Mario Kleiner
% Providing a fix for CLUT bugs in May 2017 Psychtoolbox.
% Hi Denis,
%
% all bugs should be fixed in my GitHub master branch.
%
% - 'PutImage' was utterly broken for normalized color range mode since
% forever. If this ever worked for you with that task, it would be a
% miracle. A fixed Screen() mex file will have to wait for the next
% official beta release, probably a couple of days out.
%
% In general i don't recommend use of PutImage in new code. It is awful
% code with no flexibility, miserable performance, and essentially no
% testing ever. It only exists for backwards compatibility with ancient
% code, and to scare little children.
%
% The 'PutImage' bug has to wait for the next beta release, because
% rebooting into OSX to recompile mex files puts me in a miserable mood
% very quickly, so we want to avoid that as much as possible, and i already
% lost 6 hours to this.
%
% ...
%
% For luts > 256 slots you will need a floating point framebuffer that can
% accurately represent more than 8 bit, that's why it got worse for your
% 2048 slot lut. Enabling the 11 bpc framebuffer would also cause PTB to
% use a 32 bit float ~ 23 bit linear precision intermediate virtual
% framebuffer, so that's why that partially fixed the 2048 slot lut.
%
% If you don't use a float framebuffer the data path was like this:
%
% floating point color (~23 bit) rendering into -> 8 bpc virtual
% framebuffer (rounding/quantizing from 23 bpc to 8 bpc=loss of
% precision, potential roundoff errors)-> lut mapping (convert 8 bpc back
% to 23 bpc, index into lut, output 23 bpc) -> System framebuffer of 8 bpc.
%
% With native 11 bpc mode you have:
%
% floating point color (~23 bit) rendering into -> 23 bpc virtual
% framebuffer -> lut mapping (23 bpc input index into lut, output 23 bpc)
% -> Downconversion to max. 11 bpc system framebuffer on Apple OSX. So no
% loss of precision or rounding before the lut lookup.

%% DITHERING
% Dear Beau
%
% Thanks. Here are my five technical questions (below) about how dithering
% is done on my iMac 5k and MacBook Pro.
%
% MEASUREMENTS. I've been measuring the luminance precision that I can
% attain on various Apple machines. (You've got a copy of my MATLAB test
% program, MeasureLuminancePrecision.m.) I'm very happy to be getting 11
% bits (per color channel) on my iMac 5k and my MacBook Pro (Retina,
% 15-inch, Mid 2015). Both have AMD 'Southern Islands' GPUs. AMD Radeon R9
% M290X in MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) AMD Radeon R9 M370X in
% iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014) Apple claims "deep color" for the
% iMac 5k, and not for the MacBook Pro. I get 11 bits on both.

% https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/DeepImageDisplayWithOpenGL/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016622
%
% IMPRESSIONS. Mario Kleiner supports the Psychtoolbox software, which is
% used by hundreds of scientists worldwide to do vision research on
% Macintosh computers. http://psychtoolbox.com I've done various tests with
% Mario, peeking at video GPU registers. He has the impression that
% requesting 10-bit mode in fact turns on the dithering, giving us 1 extra
% bit improvement over the iMac's 10-bit panel and 3 extra bits over the
% MacBook Pro's 8-bit panel. We are guessing that dithering is done by the
% GPU, because the very welcome dithering is unfortunately accompanied by
% loss of ability to achieve reliable time synchronization of our software
% with the display, presumably because dithering by the GPU introduces an
% indirection in the video pipeline.
%
% CONCERNS. I'm using the 11-bit precision to measure visual sensitivity
% thresholds that my professional reputation depends on. Here's a link to
% my latest poster:
% http://psych.nyu.edu/pelli/pubs/pelli2017vss-peripheral-noise.pdf The
% threshold contrasts in Fig. 2 with zero noise require luminance precision
% better than 8 bits. 10 bits might be enough. 11 bits is dandy. However,
% I'm worried that there may be systematic consequences of the dither that
% affect the archival sensitivity functions that I'm measuring and
% publishing (like those on the poster).
%
% Might an Apple engineer answer five questions about dithering on the
% MacBook Pro and iMac?
%
% FIVE QUESTIONS: 1. When in 10-bit mode, do the Macs just add a 1- or
% 3-bit static dither image to all video output before it goes through the
% 8- or 10-bit panel? 2. Is there error diffusion? 3. Does the same pixel
% image always produce the same luminance image? 4. Are successive images
% dithered independently? 5. While using dither, any suggestions for how I
% might synchronize my program to the frame store?
%
% Best Denis
%
% Mario's guesses about what's happening.
%
% What you have under macOS 10.12 in high-precision mode is half-float
% "framebuffers", which store pixels in 16 bit non-linear floating point
% format, and that allows in practice to represent at most 11 bits per
% channel linear precision for the displayable intensity range 0.0 - 1.0.
% Psychtoolbox renders into this half-float framebuffer, which is not
% actually the real framebuffer, but "faked" by the OS. Then at Flip time,
% that buffer's content is converted into the actual framebuffer format by
% the OS (probably the display server), applying Apple's proprietary
% dithering during the process, and the dithered output goes to an 8-bit
% framebuffer on the MacBook Pro, and a 10-bit framebuffer on the iMac.
% Then (presumably) the MacBookPro drives an 8-bit panel from its 8-bit
% framebuffer, and the iMac drives a native 10-bit panel from its 10-bit
% framebuffer. This indirection through the half-float to native 8- or
% 10-bit framebuffer seems to prevent precise control over when stimulus
% onset happens and any precise timestamping, killing our timing, causing
% sync test failures.
%
% It seems that under macOS, these computers are neither using the true
% depth of their framebuffers (8 and 10 bit) nor the hardware dithering.
% Instead Apple uses a proprietary algorithm. So technically it is not the
% dithering itself impairing performance so much that it kills timing.
% Instead it is the indirection from the half-float framebuffer to the real
% framebuffer that makes timing control impossible. It's the same
% mechanism/indirection used when one displays non-fullscreen windows,
% where precise timing is also impossible, because the Quartz desktop
% compositor redirects all our output into intermediate buffers to perform
% image compositing into the true framebuffer to add some bling to the
% desktop GUI.
%
% I assume the dithering is implemented by use of shaders on the GPU, maybe
% OpenGL/Metal shading language based, maybe using the OpenCL GPU compute
% language. This way they can implement their own proprietary dithering
% method, but still get hardware acceleration of the dithering from the
% GPU, so it only takes milliseconds instead of tens or hundreds of
% milliseconds. That means it doesn't impair performance too much, it only
% impairs timing of applications that need tight timing control and
% timestamping.
%
% Of course it still means they can't do really advanced algorithms, given
% a high resolution display and the constraint of only having a few msecs
% time. Probably only algorithms that operate in a small pixel
% neighbourhood of each pixel as anything else would be rather compute
% intense. Most likely not temporal dithering, as that would be more
% difficult for a software implementation, and potentially suck way more of
% the holy battery power on a laptop, but spatial dithering, but
% potentially with a dither pattern that changes at each Screen('flip'),
% ie. not re-randomized at video refresh rate, but still different for each
% stimulus frame you present.
%
% I assume the potential artifacts caused by this and its trade-offs will
% be larger the more bits you have to fake. So on the iMac it is probably
% not too bad, as you get 10 bits from the actual display hardware, so only
% have to add 1 bit via dithering. On the MacBook Pro you have to fake 3
% extra bits. In other words. i assume the dither algorithm is different
% for the MacBook Pro and the iMac.

% MARIO: I didn't perceive variation on a 8 bpc panel with your script. You

% changes systematically with your stimulus? Probably not, but who knows?
% If the way the color vectors are "tilted" off the pure luminance r=g=b
% axis would create some systematic "color contrast" edges in "color space"
% maybe it could somehow subconsciously enhance contrast if you are really
% unlucky?
%
% DENIS: see any color variation i don't need to worry. do you think that
% i'd have much better timing with bit stealing?
%
% MARIO: On Linux it won't impair timing at all, you should always get
% excellent timing.
%
% On OSX you have at least the chance of better timing on AMD graphics, as
% the processing is done within PTB, not some Apple intermediate layers. On
% the MBP with standard 8 bpc framebuffer it would probably work as well as
% anything can work timing-wise on osx. On the iMac i think a couple of
% forum posts about sync failures and their specific symptoms indicated
% that timing is always broken regardless if half-float framebuffers are
% used or not. That's weird, because there isn't any reason for a
% troublesome indirection if no custom dithering is used, but maybe that's
% just some OS bug or lazyness - not switching to normal processing even if
% special processing isn't needed.
%
% Anyway you'll find out quickly if the sync failures go away at least most
% of the time or not at all. And if you run with skipsynctest setting 1, so
% PTB continues even in case of sync failures, it will print diagnostic
% messages at each flip that will quickly tell.
%
% Of course you could also dual-boot the iMac under Linux and then have
% perfect timing and a 10 bpc panel like on the Linux HP laptop, plus the
% bit-stealing style + 2.7 bits enhancements.

% for about $300 (help PsychVideoSwitcher), which is pretty much the video
% attenuator as you co-invented it, just for use with regular color
% monitors, with some improvements. PTB has drivers for it under the
