Noise height 23.46 deg. Noise hole 23.46 deg. Height is 32.49T and hole is 32.49T, where T is target height.
Target height 0.7 deg is Letter size 0.7 deg, targetCheck 0.045 deg, noiseCheck 0.045 deg.
Nominal letter size is 0.72 deg. See o.alphabetHeightDeg below for actual size. 
No crop marks.
Target is at (0.0,0.0) deg, (0.50 0.50) in unit square. Using on-screen fixation mark.
Dynamic noise log N/(s deg^2)=-6.08, where N is power spectral density in s deg^2.
