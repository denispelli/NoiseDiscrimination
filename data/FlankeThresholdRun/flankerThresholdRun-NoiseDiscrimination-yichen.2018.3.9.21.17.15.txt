Noise height 92.14 deg. Noise hole 50.29 deg. Height is 47.02T and hole is 25.67T, where T is target height.
Adding four flankers at center spacing of 214 pix=3.0 deg=1.5x letter height. Dark contrast -1.000 (nan means same as target).
Target height 2.0 deg is Letter size 2.0 deg, targetCheck 0.196 deg, noiseCheck 0.196 deg.
Nominal letter size is 1.96 deg. See o.alphabetHeightDeg below for actual size. 
No crop marks.
