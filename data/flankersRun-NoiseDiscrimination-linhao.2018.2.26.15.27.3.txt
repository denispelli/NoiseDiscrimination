Noise height 185.40 deg. Noise hole 185.40 deg. Height is 47.17T and hole is 47.17T, where T is target height.
Adding four flankers at center spacing of 366 pix=6.0 deg=1.5x letter height. Dark contrast -0.850 (nan means same as target).
Target height 3.9 deg is Letter size 3.9 deg, targetCheck 0.197 deg, noiseCheck 0.197 deg.
Nominal letter size is 3.93 deg. See o.alphabetHeightDeg below for actual size. 
No crop marks.
Target is at (18.0,0.0) deg, (0.50 0.50) in unit square. Using on-screen fixation mark.
