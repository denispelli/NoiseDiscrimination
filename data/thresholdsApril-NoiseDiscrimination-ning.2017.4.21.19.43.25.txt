Observer is using left eyes.
NOTE: Adjusting o.nearPointXYInUnitSquare from [0.95 0.50] to [0.94 0.50] to fit 1.9 deg target (with 0.25 o.targetMargin) on screen.Offscreen fixation mark (-70.0,0.0) cm from near point of display.
Fixation cross is blanked during and until 0.60 s after target. No selective blanking near target.

Noise height 44.88 deg. Noise hole 44.88 deg. Height is 23.21T and hole is 23.21T, where T is target height.
Target height is 20.0 checks, 1.9 deg.
Letter size 1.9 deg, check size 0.097 deg.
Nominal letter size is 1.93 deg. See o.alphabetHeightDeg below for actual size. 
No crop marks.
Target is at (60.0,0.0) deg, (0.94 0.50) in unit square. Using off-screen fixation mark.
Dynamic noise log N/(s deg^2)=-Inf, where N is power spectral density in s deg^2.
