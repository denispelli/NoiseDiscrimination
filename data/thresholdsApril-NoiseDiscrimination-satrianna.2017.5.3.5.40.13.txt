Noise height 217.09 deg. Noise hole 217.09 deg. Height is 26.77T and hole is 26.77T, where T is target height.
Target height is 20.0 checks, 8.1 deg.
Letter size 8.1 deg, check size 0.406 deg.
Nominal letter size is 8.11 deg. See o.alphabetHeightDeg below for actual size. 
No crop marks.
Target is at (60.0,0.0) deg, (0.77 0.50) in unit square. Using off-screen fixation mark.
Dynamic noise log N/(s deg^2)=-Inf, where N is power spectral density in s deg^2.
