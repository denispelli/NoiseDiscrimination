Noise height 390.24 deg. Noise hole 390.24 deg. Height is 48.99T and hole is 48.99T, where T is target height.
Target height is 20.0 checks, 8.0 deg.
Letter size 8.0 deg, check size 0.398 deg.
Nominal letter size is 7.97 deg. See o.alphabetHeightDeg below for actual size. 
No crop marks.
Target is at (-10.0,0.0) deg, (0.50 0.50) in unit square. Using on-screen fixation mark.
Dynamic noise log N/(s deg^2)=-4.17, where N is power spectral density in s deg^2.
