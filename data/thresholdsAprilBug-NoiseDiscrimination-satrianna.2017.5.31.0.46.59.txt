Observer is using right eye.
NOTE: Adjusting o.nearPointXYInUnitSquare from [0.05 0.50] to [0.13 0.50] to fit 4.1 deg target (with 0.25 o.targetMargin) on screen.Offscreen fixation mark (36.2,0.0) cm from near point of display.
Fixation cross is blanked during and until 0.60 s after target. No selective blanking near target.

Noise height 95.66 deg. Noise hole 95.66 deg. Height is 23.13T and hole is 23.13T, where T is target height.
Target height is 22.0 checks, 4.1 deg.
Letter size 4.1 deg, check size 0.188 deg.
Nominal letter size is 4.14 deg. See o.alphabetHeightDeg below for actual size. 
No crop marks.
Target is at (-30.0,0.0) deg, (0.13 0.50) in unit square. Using off-screen fixation mark.
Dynamic noise log N/(s deg^2)=-4.82, where N is power spectral density in s deg^2.
