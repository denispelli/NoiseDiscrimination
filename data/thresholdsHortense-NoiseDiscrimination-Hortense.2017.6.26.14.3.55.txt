Noise height 188.30 deg. Noise hole 188.30 deg. Height is 23.37T and hole is 23.37T, where T is target height.
Target height is 20.0 checks, 8.1 deg.
Letter size 8.1 deg, check size 0.403 deg.
Nominal letter size is 8.06 deg. See o.alphabetHeightDeg below for actual size. 
No crop marks.
Target is at (0.0,0.0) deg, (0.50 0.50) in unit square. Using on-screen fixation mark.
Dynamic noise log N/(s deg^2)=-Inf, where N is power spectral density in s deg^2.
