Noise height 39.55 deg. Noise hole 21.42 deg. Height is 37.73T and hole is 20.44T, where T is target height.
Adding radial flankers with nominal spacing of 114 pix=1.5 deg=1.4x letter height. Dark contrast -0.060 (nan means same as target).
Target height 1.0 deg is Letter size 1.0 deg, targetCheck 0.052 deg, noiseCheck 0.052 deg.
Nominal letter size is 1.05 deg. See o.alphabetHeightDeg below for actual size.
