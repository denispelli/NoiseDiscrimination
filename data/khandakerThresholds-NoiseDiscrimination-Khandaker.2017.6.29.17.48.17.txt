Noise height 296.64 deg. Noise hole 296.64 deg. Height is 37.73T and hole is 37.73T, where T is target height.
Target height is 20.0 checks, 7.9 deg.
Letter size 7.9 deg, check size 0.393 deg.
Nominal letter size is 7.86 deg. See o.alphabetHeightDeg below for actual size. 
No crop marks.
Target is at (0.0,0.0) deg, (0.50 0.50) in unit square. Using on-screen fixation mark.
Static noise log N/(deg^2)=-2.40, where N is power spectral density in deg^2.
