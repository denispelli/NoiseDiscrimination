o.targetModulates luminance
o.noiseType gaussian, o.noiseSD 0.000, o.annularNoiseSD 0.000
Noise height 27.75 deg. Noise hole 27.75 deg. Height is 26.95T and hole is 26.95T, where T is target height.
Target height is 22.0 checks, 1.0 deg.
Letter size 1.03 deg, central check size 0.047 deg (corrected for perspective).
Nominal letter size is 1.03 deg. See o.alphabetHeightDeg below for actual size. 
No crop marks.
Eccentricity 0.0 deg. Using fixation mark. Target offset 0.00 of screen width.
Dynamic noise log N/(s deg^2)=-Inf, where N is power spectral density in s deg^2.
pThreshold 0.75, beta 3.5
Your (log) guess is NaN +/- NaN

o.alphabetHeightDeg 1.03 deg (bounding box for letters used, including any ascenders and descenders)
log E1/deg^2 -0.25, where E1 is energy at unit contrast.
Screen brightness was set to 100%, but now reads as 89%.
