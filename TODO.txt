run test scripts for various tasks, various conditions and different
modes (human observer and algorithm, snapshot, bit depth, assess

Now only o.task: identify is supported with dynamic noise
Support 4AFC etc. tasks

fix snapshot using a copy of the signal texture

make use of noise pool and texture processing to take advantage of small
pool size and limited GPU memory
