%
% BRIGHTNESS. Get and set the "brightness" slider in the macOS: System
% Preferences: Displays panel. The function argument "newLevel" (0.0
% to 1.0) indicates the desired brightness. If you call without an argument
% (or -1) then nothing is changed. The current state is always reported in
% the returned oldLevel (0.0 to 1.0). The optionally returned "status" is
% always zero unless the applescript failed, in which case oldLevel is NaN.
%
% CAUTION: If the user has not yet given permission for MATLAB to control
% the computer (in System Preferences:Security & Privacy:Accessibility),
% then the Brightness applescript will put up a helpful alert and wait for
% the user to enable control. Call Brightness BEFORE you open a
% Psychtoolbox window: If the alert window is hidden by a Psychtoolbox
% window, then the user won't know that the program is waiting for him or
% her. For this reason the Brightness function will abort with an error if
% you try to call it while an onscreen window is already open. To prevent
% this confusing situation, we now fail with an explanatory error if you
% try to call Brightness while a window is open.
%
% Brightness.m uses the Brightness.applescript to set the "brightness"
% slider in the macOS: System Preferences: Displays panel. For use in
% MATLAB, please put both files anywhere in MATLAB's path. I hope they will
% someday be added to the Psychtoolbox.

% a number.

%
% This MATLAB function calls my Brightness applescript. The applescript is
% equivalent to manually opening the System Preferences:Displays panel and
% adjusting the "brightness" slider. I wrote the script to be invoked from
% MATLAB, but you could call it from any macOS application. Adjusting the
% "brightness" setting in an LCD, controls the luminance of the fluorescent
% light that is behind the liquid crystal display. I believe that the
% "brightness" slider controls only the luminance of the source, and does
% not affect the liquid crystal itsef, which is controlled by the color
% lookup table. The luminance at the viewer's eye is presumably the product
% of the two factors: luminance of the source and transmission of the
% liquid crystal, at each wavelength.
%
% INSTALLATION. To work with MATLAB, please put both files anywhere in
% MATLAB's path. I hope they will be added to the Psychtoolbox.
%
% CAUTION. This uses the "System Preferences: Displays" panel, which takes
% 30 s to open if it isn't already open. I set up the Brightness
% applescript to always leave System Preferences open, so you won't waste
% your observer's time waiting 30 s for System Preferences to open every
% time you call Brightness.
%
% SCREEN CONFIGURE DISPLAY BRIGHTNESS. The macOS version of Psychtoolbox
% already has a SCREEN call to get and set the brightness, but its setting
% ability seems to be unreliable in macOS Sierra, so I'm providing this
% Applescript alternative. The Psychtoolbox call is:
% [oldBrightness]=Screen('ConfigureDisplay','Brightness', screenId [,outputId][,brightness]); 
% Normally the SCREEN call is preferable because it's fast and requires no
% permissions. The solid new symptom under macOS Sierra is that the slider
% doesn't move when you change the brightness. Associated with that I find
% that the brightness doesn't always change, or changes at a later
% inappropriate time. I haven't yet managed to produce a reliably
% replicable fault, but have encountered many instances where my program
% detected, by calling the SCREEN command, that my attempt to set
% brightness had failed. Thus, this new BRIGHTNESS applescript is offered
% as a temporary work-around until Apple fixs the bug in their brightness
% API or we find a better way to work around it.
%
% APPLE SECURITY. The first time any application (e.g. MATLAB) calls
% Brightness.applescript, the request will be blocked and an error dialog
% window will appear saying the application is "not allowed assistive
% access." This means that the application needs an administrator's
% permission to access the System Preferences. A user with admin privileges
% should then click as requested to provide that permission. This needs to
% be done only once (for each application).
%
% MULTIPLE SCREENS: All my computers have only one screen, so I haven't had
% an opportunity to test the screenNumber argument.
%
% LINUX and WINDOWS. Applescript works only under macOS. When running
% under any operating system other that macOS, this program ignores the
% newLevel argument and always returns -1 as the oldLevel. It is
% conceivable that Apple's auto brightness feature is implemented on
% Macintoshes running Linux or Windows. If that applies to you, please
% consider enhancing this program to return a correct answer for that case,
% and sharing the result with me and the Psychtoolbox forum.
