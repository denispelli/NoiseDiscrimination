-- AutoBrightness.applescript
-- Denis G. Pelli denis.pelli@nyu.edu
-- May 21, 2015. 
-- Enhanced May 29, 2015 to allow specification of screenNumber.
-- I hope this new version will work with Macs running under Mac OS X
-- localized for any language, not just English. For this, we now select
-- the Display/Colors panel by the internal name "displaysDisplayTab" 
-- instead using the localized name "Display". 
-- June 1, 2015. Polished the comments.
--July 25, 2015 Previously worked on Mavericks (Mac OS X 10.9). 
--Now enhanced to also support Yosemite (Mac OS X 10.10.4).
--Not yet tested on earlier version of Mac OS X (< 10.9) or
--on El Capitan (OS X 10.11).
--
-- This applescript allows you to disable (or re-enable) a feature of Apple 
-- Macintosh liquid crystal displays that is undesirable for vision experiments 
-- and display calibration. This applescript is equivalent to manually opening
-- the System Preference:Displays and turning on or off the checkbox for
-- "Automatic brightness adjustment". I wrote the script to be invoked from
-- MATLAB, but you could call it from any application running under Mac OS X.
-- While "Automatically adjust brightness" is checked, the Mac OS uses the
-- video camera to sense the room luminance and slowly dims the display if
-- the room is dark. It does this by adjusting the "brightness" setting,
-- which controls the luminance of the fluorescent light that is behind the
-- liquid crystal display. I believe that this "brightness" setting controls only the
-- luminance of the source, and does not affect the liquid crystal display,
-- which is controlled by the color lookup table. The screen luminance is 
-- presumably the product of the two factors: luminance of the source 
-- and transmission of the liquid crystal, at each wavelength.
--
-- CAUTION: This script uses the "System Preferences: Displays" panel,
-- which takes 30 s to open, if it isn't already open.  You should either
-- open System Preferences in advance, or be prepared to wait 30 s when you
-- call this script. If System Preferences was already open, then this script 
-- leaves it open. If it was not already open, there is an option in the code,
-- "leaveSystemPrefsRunning", which I set to true, so you don't waste the
-- observer's time waiting 30 s for System Preferences to open every time
-- you call AutoBrightness.
--
-- AutoBrightness screenNumber newStatus
-- The parameter "newStatus" (integer 0 or 1) indicates whether you want to
-- turn the autobrightness feature on (newStatus==1) or off (newStatus==0).
-- If  the newStatus argument is omitted (or anything other than 0 or 1)
-- then nothing is changed, and the current state is reported in the
-- returned value (0 or 1). However, the returned value is -99 if your 
-- application (e.g. MATLAB) does not have permission to control your computer 
-- (see APPLE SECURITY below).
--
-- In MATLAB, use the corresponding MATLAB Psychtoolbox function, which calls 
-- this script:
--
-- oldStatus=AutoBrightness(newStatus);
--
-- To call this directly from MATLAB, 
-- [status,oldAuto]=system('osascript AutoBrightness.applescript 0'); % to disable
-- [status,oldAuto]=system('osascript AutoBrightness.applescript 1'); % to enable
-- system(['osascript AutoBrightness.applescript ' num2str(oldAuto)]); % to restore
-- Use from any other language is very similar.
-- Ignore the returned "status", which seems to always be zero.
-- The string argument to system() is passed without processing by MATLAB.
-- It appears that MATLAB's path is not used in finding the script,
-- "Autobrightness.applescript". When I don't specify a path for the
-- applescript file, it appears that system() assumes
-- that it's in /User/denispelli/Documents/MATLAB/
-- I succeeded in using my applescript from an arbitrary location by
-- specifying its full path. (See AutoBrightness.m.) 
--
-- BEWARE OF DELAY: This script uses the "System Preferences: Displays" panel,
-- which takes 30 s to open, if it isn't already open.  You should either
-- open System Preferences in advance, or be prepared to wait 30 s when you
-- call this script. Whether or not System Preferences was already open, this script 
-- leaves it open, so you don't waste the observer's time waiting 30 s for System 
-- Preferences to open every time you call AutoBrightness. 
--
-- APPLE SECURITY. Unless the application (e.g. MATLAB) calling this script
-- has permission to control the computer, attempts to changes settings will be blocked.
-- In that case the appropriate Security and Privacy System Preference panel is opened 
-- and an error dialog window asks the user to provide the permission. A user with 
-- admin privileges should then click as requested to provide that permission. 
-- This needs to be done only once for each application that calls this script. 
-- The permission is remembered forever. Once permission granted, 
-- subsequent calls of this script will work. Note that a user lacking admin access 
-- is unable to grant the permission; in that case every time you call this 
-- script, you'll get the error dialog window.
-- 
-- SCRIPTING CONTROL ALLOWED? 
-- You can call Denis Pelli's innocuous script "ScriptingAllowed.applescript" to find out
-- whether scripting permission has been granted. http://psych.nyu.edu/pelli/software.html
--
-- MULTIPLE SCREENS: All my computers have only one screen, so 
-- I haven't yet tested it with values of screenNumber other than zero.
--
-- BRIGHTNESS: You may also want to read and set the display brightness as
-- indicated by the 16-position "brightnes" slider on the System Preferences:Displays
-- panel. I have commented out a line, "set slider 1", in the script below,
-- which would implement that feature. However, the Psychtoolbox for MATLAB
-- and Macintosh already has a Screen call to get and set the brightness, so
-- we don't need applescript for that.
--
-- THANKS. Thanks to Mario Kleiner for explaining how Mac OSX "brightness" works.
-- Thanks to nick.peatfield@gmail.com for sharing his applescript code for dimmer.scpt and brighter.scpt.
