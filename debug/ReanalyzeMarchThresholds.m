% Fix threshold contrasts measured in January-March 2017. We got great Neq
% data from Chen and Ning. We included Chen's data in my NIH grant proposal
% sent mid March. Ning's data agree with Chen's at high contrast, but was
% crazy at low contrast. Eventually I discovered two bugs. Firstly CLUT was
% loaded AFTER the trial, so each trial ran at the nominal contrast of the
% previous trial. This can be overcome by reanalyzing the data, with the
% correct association of response and trial. More important, I discovered
% that we were attaining only 8 bits of luminance precision. As a
% consequence all nominal contrasts of 0.78% or above were correct (with
% negligible rounding error) and all contrasts below that were rounded to
% 0.78% or zero. That discrepancy between actual and nominal contrast led
% Quest to estimate absurdly low thresholds for Ning. Again, we can
% overcome the bug by reanalyzing the data with the actual contrast.

% actualC=0.0078*round(nominalC/0.0078);

% When we enhanced NoiseDiscrimination to show dynamic noise, the single
% image presentation was expanced to be a movie. In this program contrast
% is controlled by loading the CLUT (color lookup table). Formerly the CLUT
% was loaded by the same Screen Flip command the presented the stimulus
% image. The movie code left the CLUT loading to happen after the whole
% movie was shown. The the trial was displayed with the CLUT and contrast
% remaining from the last trial. Fixing NoiseDiscrimination is easy, simply
% loading the CLUT before the movie. We collected data for a few weeks with
% that bug. This program salvages the data, correctly pairing the contrast
% and response and running Quest again to obtain a valid threshold estimate
% to replace the old invalid one. Chen provided MATLAB code to cycle
% through our MAT files. I added code to run Quest and save the results.

% Actual N at each eccentricity. The program's computation of power
% spectral density assumes display at site of target is orthogonal to line
% of sight (from eye) and at specified viewing distance. In fact the
% display was orthogonal to line of sight at fixation point, and thus
% tilted at the target site. The target site is further than the nominal
% viewing distance. Our target is along the horizontal meridian so the tilt
% compressed along the x axis without affecting the y axis. This reduces
% power spectral density N by a factor of cos(phi), where phi is
% eccentricity. The ratio of nominal to actual distance is cos(phi). This
% scales both x and y, so it reduces N by a factor of cos(phi)^2. Thus the
% actual N(phi) is cos(phi)^3*N.

% Actual letter size at each eccentricity. For a given letter area in
% pixels, the letter area in deg^2 drops with eccentricity just like check
% area, as cos(eccentricity)^3. Here we specify letter size, so I multiply it
% by cos(eccentricity)^1.5, so the actual letter area will equal letter
% "size" squared.
