% function GammaTableBug() 
%
% I figured out what's wrong. The sequence of luminances displayed on my
% MacBook Pro 15" is smoother than the values I loaded into the CLUT. The
% white (1.0) that I requested was coming out darker because the subsequent
% values in the lookup table are darker. When I replace the neighboring
% CLUT elements with white, then I get a good white. I suppose an Apple or
% AMD engineer thought it would be helpful to smooth the CLUT. (The error
% is not visible to ReadNormalizedGammaTable.) Can we prevent that?
%
% Loads a ramp into the first 12 elements of the CLUT using
% LoadNormalizedGammaTable. The ramp goes from black (0.0) to white (1.0).
% The ramp is always read back correctly by ReadNormalizedGammaTable.
% However, the resulting luminances are wrong on my MacBook Pro, even
% though they are correct on my MacBook Air. This demo displays the 12 CLUT
% entries all at once as an image, nominally a luminance ramp, in the upper
% left. The gamma values appear below, and are also printed on the screen.
% [0 0.6617 0.7001 0.7374 0.7661 .7916 .8137 0.8361 1.0 1 1 1] One of the
% CLUT entries is displayed as a square in the middle of the screen, for
% photometry. Each time you hit the shift key it advances to the next. A
% numerical display tells you the gamma value displayed. The displayed
% luminances are wrong, as explained below, even though
% ReadNormalizedGammaTable always returns exactly what I loaded.
%
% On my MacBookPro (running PTB 3.0.14), the darker part of the ramp
% looks ok, but the nominally full white, 1.0, on the right, is less bright
% than the gray that precedes it. In now runs fine on my MacBook Air, now
% running PTB 3.0.14. However, while running PTB 3.0.13, the MacBook Air
% displayed the nominally black patch (0.0) as white, and all the
% nominally gray and white patches appeared black.

% The last time I wrote to you about CLUT problems, you advised me to use
% EnableCLUTMapping. That helped a lot at the time. However, right now,
% I have the same problem, with or without EnableCLUTMapping.
