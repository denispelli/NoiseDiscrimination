% If returnOneChar is true (default) then "response" is just one character,
% if possible. (Some keynames, like 'left_shift', have no obviously
% associated character and are passed through.) This does not distinguish
% between pressing a number key on the main or separate numeric keyboard.
% If returnOneChar is false, then the full descriptive output of KbName is
% returned, unmodified, e.g. 'a', '1!', 'ESCAPE', or 'left_shift'.
%
% To specify a number key on a regular keyboard, use both characters on the
% key, e.g. KbName('1!'). Using KbName('1') specifies the '1' key on a
% numeric key pad.

   % By default, simulate the behavior of GetChar(), i.e. return an ASCII

   % principle associated with a different ASCII code when shifted, but we
   % ignore the shift. Also some ASCII codes (e.g. '1') are associated with
   % multiple keys (on main keyboard and numeric keypad). And some keys
   % (e.g. shift) have no ASCII code. We convert some long character names,
   % e.g. 'escape', back to the single ASCII code. When KbName returns two
