% Convert position from deg (relative to fixation) to (x,y) coordinate in
% o.stimulusRect. Deg increase right and up. Pix are in Apple screen
% coordinates which increase down and right. In terms of geometry, the
% perspective transformation is relative to location of near point, which
% is orthogonal to line of sight. "location" refers to the near point. We
% often put the target there, but that is not assumed in this routine.
% In spatial-uncertainty experiments, we typically put fixation at the near
% point.
% xyDeg must have two columns, for x and y, and may have any number of
% rows, including none.
