function [oldVolume,failed]=SoundVolume(newVolume)
% oldVolume=SoundVolume(newVolume);
% Read and set the output volume slider on the macOS: System Preferences:
% Sound: Output panel. The argument "newVolume" (in range 0.0 to 1.0) is
% optional, and, if present, indicates that you want to set the volume. If
% you call SoundVolume without the newSetting argument or [], then nothing
% is changed. The current state is always reported in the returned
% oldVolume (in range 0.0 to 1.0). The optionally returned "failed" is an
% error code and is always zero unless the osascript failed.
%
% Note that there won't be any sound if muting is on. You can use
% SoundMuting to assess and control muting.
%
% Takes about one second to read and set the volume.

% SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY. It's based on basic osascripts so I suppose it'll
% work on all versions of macOS. I hope SoundVolume can be extended to
% support Windows and Linux.
