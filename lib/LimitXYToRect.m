function xy=LimitXYToRect(xy,rect)
% xy=LimitXYToRect(xy,rect);
% Restrict x and y to lie inside rect.
% If xy is inside rect, return it.
% If xy is outside rect, return nearest point on rect.
% Rect is defined by two points, [x1 y1 x2 y2].
% In Apple screen coordinates y increases downward, 
% whereas in ordinary coordinates, y increases upward.
% Thus we assume x2 >= x1, but we don't assume any 
% relation between y2 and y1.
