%
% BRIGHTNESS. Get and set the "brightness" slider in the macOS: System
% Preferences: Displays panel. The function argument "newLevel" (0.0
% to 1.0) indicates the desired brightness. If you call without an argument
% then nothing is changed. The current state is always reported in
% the returned oldLevel (0.0 to 1.0). The optionally returned "status" is
% always zero unless the applescript failed, in which case oldLevel is NaN.
%
% ON ERROR:  If there is an error we close any open Psychtoolbox window.
%
% PERMISSION: If the user has not yet given permission for MATLAB to
% control the computer (in System Preferences:Security &
% Privacy:Accessibility), then we give an error alerting the user to grant
% this permission.
%
% Brightness.m uses either the Brightness.applescript or
% Screen('ConfigureDisplay','Brightness,...) to set the "brightness" slider
% in the macOS: System Preferences: Displays panel. For use in MATLAB,
% please put both files anywhere in MATLAB's path.
%
% June 25, 2017. Written by denis.pelli@nyu.edu for the Psychtoolbox.
% June 28, 2017, Fixed type of returned value, formerly a string, to now be
% a number.
% July 20, 2017. Enhanced to cope with spaces in the path to the applescript.
% December 1, 2018. Put try-catch block around the code, to gracefully cope
% with error while Screen window obscures the MATLAB Command Window.
% Eliminated the check for Screen window, which is no longer an issue.
% July 16,2019 Improved by looking at code here:
% https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/272531/dim-screen-brightness-of-mbp-using-applescript-and-while-using-a-secondary-mon/285907
% August 2019. If Psychotoolbox version at least 3.0.16, then use Screen
% instead of Applescript.
%
% Depending on the version of the Psychtoolbox, this MATLAB function calls
% either Screen('ConfigureDisplay','Brightness'...) or Brightness
% applescript. When they work, both functions are equivalent to manually
% opening the System Preferences:Displays panel and adjusting the
% "brightness" slider. The applescript was written to be invoked from
% MATLAB, but you could call it from any macOS application.
%
% TECHNICAL: Adjusting the "brightness" setting in an LCD, controls the
% luminance of the fluorescent light that is behind the liquid crystal
% display. I believe that the "brightness" slider controls only the
% luminance of the source, and does not affect the liquid crystal itsef,
% which is controlled by the color lookup table. The luminance at the
% viewer's eye is presumably the product of the two factors: luminance of
% the source and transmission of the liquid crystal, at each wavelength.
%
% INSTALLATION. To work with MATLAB, please put both the .m and
% .applescript files anywhere in MATLAB's path.
%
% APPLESCRIPT IS SLOW. It uses the "System Preferences: Displays" panel,
% which takes 30 s to open if it isn't already open. We set up the
% Brightness applescript to always leave System Preferences open, so you
% won't waste your observer's time waiting 30 s for System Preferences to
% open every time you call Brightness.
%
% SCREEN CONFIGURE DISPLAY BRIGHTNESS. The macOS version of Psychtoolbox
% already has a SCREEN call to get and set the brightness, but its setting
% ability seems to be unreliable in macOS Sierra, so I'm providing this
% Applescript alternative. The Psychtoolbox call is:
% [oldBrightness]=Screen('ConfigureDisplay','Brightness', screenId [,outputId][,brightness]);
% Normally the SCREEN call is preferable because it's fast and requires no
% permissions. The solid new symptom under macOS Sierra is that the slider
% doesn't move when you change the brightness. Associated with that I find
% that the brightness doesn't always change, or changes at a later
% inappropriate time. I haven't yet managed to produce a reliably
% replicable fault, but have encountered many instances where my program
% detected, by calling the SCREEN command, that my attempt to set
% brightness had failed. Thus, this new BRIGHTNESS applescript is offered
% as a temporary work-around until Apple fixs the bug in their brightness
% API or we find a better way to work around it.
%
% APPLE SECURITY. The first time any application (e.g. MATLAB) calls
% Brightness.applescript, the request will be blocked and an error dialog
% window will appear saying the application is "not allowed assistive
% access." This means that the application needs an administrator's
% permission to access the System Preferences. A user with admin privileges
% should then click as requested to provide that permission. This needs to
% be done only once (for each application).
%
% MULTIPLE SCREENS: All my computers have only one screen, so I haven't had
% an opportunity to test the screenNumber argument.
%
% LINUX and WINDOWS. Applescript works only under macOS. When running
% under any operating system other that macOS, this program ignores the
% newLevel argument and always returns -1 as the oldLevel. It is
% conceivable that Apple's auto brightness feature is implemented on
% Macintoshes running Linux or Windows. If that applies to you, please
% consider enhancing this program to return a correct answer for that case,
% and sharing the result with me and the Psychtoolbox forum.
