function oooOut=RunExperiment2(ooo)
% ooo=RunExperiment2(ooo);
%
% ooo is a cell array representing an experiment. Each cell represents one
% block of the experiment, and contains an array struct oo, with one "o"
% struct per condition. All the conditions in the array are randomly
% interleaved during testing. It is common to have just one condition. Each
% "o" struct has many fields, including o.trials.
%
% KEEP WINDOW OPEN THROUGHOUT EXPERIMENT: The psychtoolbox Screen command
% takes tens of seconds to open a window and a similar time to close it.
% It's unpleasant for observers to wait through those delays more than
% once. To eliminate needless waiting, the first time we call
% NoiseDiscrimination to run a block of trials, it opens a window. That
% window fills the whole screen, unless you've set o.useFractionOfScreenToDebug
% less than 1 (to facilitate debugging). That window stays open when
% NoiseDiscrimination returns, so it's ready for the next block, and so on,
% until we reach the end of the experiment (end of the "ooo" cell array),
% or the user hits ESCAPE and chooses to o.quitExperiment.
%
% RESUME INCOMPLETE EXPERIMENT: Optionally resume a partially-completed
% experiment. When you call RunExperiment, we first look in the data folder
% for a partially-done experiment with the same o.experiment name, done on
% this computer. (Alas, we don't yet know the observer's name, so we can't
% search for it.) If we find one or more matching partial experiment file
% we ask, for each, if you want to finish it (or delete it or skip it). If
% you say YES then we ignore the oo argument that you passed (and the rest
% of the matching partial-experiment files), and instead load up oo from
% the disk file. One by one we run the conditions that still don't have
% enough trials, until the observer quits or we reach the end of the
% experiment. Then we save the completed experiment to disk, without
% "partial" in the filename.

% TO DO: DELETE OBSOLETE EXPERIMENT SUMMARY. Once we save the new file we
% ought to delete the old partial, since its data are now obsolete,
% duplicated in the new complete experiment file.

% Once we call onCleanup, until RunExperiment ends, CloseWindowsAndCleanup
% will run (closing any open windows) when this function terminates for any
% reason, whether by reaching the end, the posting of an error here or in
% any function called from here, or the user hitting control-C.
