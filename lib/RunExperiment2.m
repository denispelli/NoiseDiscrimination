function out=RunExperiment2(ooo)
% ooo=RunExperiment2(ooo);
%
% ooo is a cell array representing an experiment. Each cell represents one
% block of the experiment, and contains an array struct oo, with one "o"
% struct per condition. All the conditions in the array are randomly
% interleaved during testing. It is common to have just one condition. Each
% o struct has many fields, including o.trials.
%
% KEEP WINDOW OPEN THROUGHOUT EXPERIMENT: The psychtoolbox Screen command
% takes maybe 30 s to open a window and a similar time to close it. It's
% unpleasant for observers to wait through those delays more than once. To
% eliminate needless waiting, the first time we call NoiseDiscrimination to
% run a block of trials, it opens a window. That window typically fills the
% whole screen, unless you've set o.useFractionOfScreen less than 1 (to
% facilitate debugging). That window stays open when NoiseDiscrimination
% returns, so it's ready for the next block, and so on, until we reach the
% end of the experiment (end of the "oo" cell array), or the user hits
% ESCAPE and chooses to o.quitExperiment.
%
% RESUME: Optionally resume a partially-completed experiment. When you call
% RunExperiment, we first look in the data folder for a partially-done
% experiment with the same o.experiment name, done on this computer. (Alas,
% we don't yet know the observer's name, so we can't search for it.) If we
% find one or more matching partial experiment file we ask, for each, if
% you want to finish it (or delete it or skip it). If you say YES then we
% ignore the oo argument that you passed (and the rest of the matching
% partial-experiment files), and instead load up oo from the disk file. One
% by one we run the conditions that still don't have enough trials, until
% the observer quits or we reach the end of the experiment. Then we save
% the completed experiment to disk, without "partial" in the filename.

% TO DO: DELETE OBSOLETE EXPERIMENT SUMMARY. Once we save the new file we
% ought to delete the old partial, since its data are now obsolete,
% duplicated in the new complete experiment file.

% Once we call onCleanup, until RunExperiment ends, MyCleanupFunction will
% run (closing any open windows) when this function terminates for any
% reason, whether by reaching the end, the posting of an error here or in
% any function called from here, or the user hitting control-C.
